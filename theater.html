        <h3>THE CHERRY ORCHARD writen by Anton Chekov</h3>
        <p class = "direction"> [A reception-room cut off from a drawing-room by an arch. Chandelier
            lighted. A Jewish band, the one mentioned in Act II, is heard playing
            in another room. Evening. In the drawing-room the grand rond is being
            danced. Voice of SIMEONOV PISCHIN "Promenade a une paire!" Dancers
            come into the reception-room; the first pair are PISCHIN and CHARLOTTA
            IVANOVNA; the second, TROFIMOV and LUBOV ANDREYEVNA; the third, ANYA and
            the POST OFFICE CLERK; the fourth, VARYA and the STATION-MASTER, and
            so on. VARYA is crying gently and wipes away her tears as she dances.
            DUNYASHA is in the last pair. They go off into the drawing-room,
            PISCHIN shouting, "Grand rond, balancez:" and "Les cavaliers Ã  genou
            et remerciez vos dames!" FIERS, in a dress-coat, carries a tray with
            seltzer-water across. Enter PISCHIN and TROFIMOV from the drawing-room.] </p>
            
        <h3 class = "PISCHIN">PISCHIN</h3>
        <p class = "speech">I'm full-blooded and have already had two strokes; it's hard
            for me to dance, but, as they say, if you're in Rome, you must do as
            Rome does. I've got the strength of a horse. My dead father, who liked
            a joke, peace to his bones, used to say, talking of our ancestors,
            that the ancient stock of the Simeonov-Pischins was descended from that
            identical horse that Caligula made a senator....</p>

        <p class = "speech">But the trouble is, I've no money! A hungry dog only believes in meat.</p>

        <p class = "speech">Yes. There is something equine about your figure.</p>
            
        <h3 class="PISCHIN">PISCHIN</h3> <p class = "speech">Well... a horse is a fine animal... you can sell a horse.</p>
            
        <p class = "direction">[Billiard playing can be heard in the next room. VARYA appears under the
            arch.]</p>

            life, have spent in looking for money to pay interest had been used
            for something else, then, I believe, after all, you'd be able to turn
            everything upside down.</p>

            man... a man of enormous brain, says in his books that you can forge
            bank-notes.</p>
            
            <h3 class = "TROFIMOV"> TROFIMOV</h3>  <p class = "speech">And have you read Nietzsche?</p>
            
            <h3 class = "PISCHIN"> PISCHIN</h3>  <p class = "speech">Well... Dashenka told me. Now I'm in such a position, I
            wouldn't mind forging them... I've got to pay 310 roubles the day after
            to-morrow... I've got 130 already....</p> <p class = "direction"> [Feels his pockets, nervously]</p>
